          Abhivarta is the flagship sports event of Manipal University Jaipur (MUJ). Players from all over the state as well as from other parts of India come together to participate and prove their mettle against their peers.
          <br />The design of Abhivarta follows a curtain-like design to exhibit the fluid transitioning between pages as well as sections of a page. It has been built on Vanilla JS with Google Firebase as the database and PHP for the mail functionality.
